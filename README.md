Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Qdrant and Groq

Overview

This project implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Qdrant as the vector database and Groq as the LLM provider. RAG enhances the accuracy of language models by retrieving relevant context from external sources before generating responses, making it a powerful approach for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Features

Efficient Vector Search: Uses Qdrant to store and retrieve embeddings quickly.
Fast and Cost-effective LLM Inference: Uses Groq's LLM for high-performance text generation.
Seamless Integration: Connects Qdrant with Groq for real-time response generation.
Scalability: Supports large-scale document retrieval and processing.

**STEPS TO DO IT-**

<h3>SETP 1</h3>
You'll need to install the following Python packages for this script to work properly. Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install os dotenv qdrant-client sentence-transformers groq tiktoken PyPDF2 numpy
```

### Breakdown of required packages:
1. **`python-dotenv`** – For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.  
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```
2. **`qdrant-client`** – For interacting with Qdrant, a vector database.  
   ```bash
   pip install qdrant-client
   ```
3. **`sentence-transformers`** – For embedding sentences into vectors.  
   ```bash
   pip install sentence-transformers
   ```
4. **`groq`** – For accessing Groq API services.  
   ```bash
   pip install groq
   ```
5. **`tiktoken`** – For tokenization.  
   ```bash
   pip install tiktoken
   ```
6. **`PyPDF2`** – For reading PDF files.  
   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```
7. **`numpy`** – For numerical operations.  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
