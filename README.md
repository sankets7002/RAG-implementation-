Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Qdrant and Groq

Overview

This project implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Qdrant as the vector database and Groq as the LLM provider. RAG enhances the accuracy of language models by retrieving relevant context from external sources before generating responses, making it a powerful approach for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Features

Efficient Vector Search: Uses Qdrant to store and retrieve embeddings quickly.
Fast and Cost-effective LLM Inference: Uses Groq's LLM for high-performance text generation.
Seamless Integration: Connects Qdrant with Groq for real-time response generation.
Scalability: Supports large-scale document retrieval and processing.
